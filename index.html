<p style = "font-family: georgia;" ALIGN = center >Youth of Maresyev:<br><br>
• Alexey Petrovich Maresyev was born on May 29th, 1916 in the city of Kamyshin in the Kamyshin district.
  <br><br>
• Joined the army when he reached the required age. Unfortunately, he was sent to the Far East as part of a "special" group to help assemble a city.
<br><br>
• The direct truth is that he had already genetic programing that made him suspect the possibility of a rush for survival. This isolated expectation for determined survival has lead him to become a legend (that he himself doesn't want to acknowledge.... seems personal) in the eyes of the expected civilian. Using his youth to train wasn't the only successful method for survival in the harshest conditions. The image of a parsed understanding of his tribe was enough for him to dislocate from the consciousness of the illusion of falsity, instead he pushed forward in a simplistic manner that is direct. A true man.
<br><br>
• Subsequently introduced himself to the Military School of Aviation, an institution for professional pilots, thus training aggressively to gain the contemplation for available solutions for the individual who qualifies apropos to the instructor’s function. Soon graduated in 1940--retained as an instructor at the school.
  <br><br>
• Apparently Alexey Maresyev was the youngest of four sons. His mother was named Galina Viktorovna Maresias (seems slightly different from Maresyev----is there a reason? Sure, I'm not reading into it).
  <br><br>
• With more inscrupable attention to details----it seems that Alexey also had a brother---his name being Victor (died in the year of 2002, one year later from Alexey's death at 84).
